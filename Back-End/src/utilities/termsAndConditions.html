      Welcome to beComfree. These terms and conditions outline the rules and
      regulations for the use of our website.

    <h2>2. Use License</h2>
    <p>
      Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials
      (information or software) on beComfree's website for personal,
      non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license,
      not a transfer of title.
    </p>
    <p>
      This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
      restrictions and may be terminated by beComfree at any time. Upon
      terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of
      this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession
      whether in electronic or printed format.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Account</h2>
    <p>
      To access certain features of our website or make purchases, you may be
      required to create an account with us. You are responsible for maintaining
      the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting
      access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all
      activities that occur under your account or password.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>
      All content included on this website, such as text, graphics, logos,
      button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations,
      and software, is the property of beComfree or its content suppliers and
      protected by international copyright laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform,
      reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or
      sell any information, software, products or services obtained from this
      website.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In no event shall beComfree or its suppliers be liable for any damages
      (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due
      to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the
      materials on beComfree's website, even if beComfree or a beComfree
      authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
      possibility of such damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
      or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
      limitations may not apply to you.
